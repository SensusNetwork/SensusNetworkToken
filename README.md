The essence of governance lies in delivering to the citizens the rights, privileges, and provisions enshrined in the Constitution of each of these countries with respect to political, economic and social freedom .Blockchain is emerging as the new global infrastructure where we have the opportunity to build and deploy networks that serve the best interests of our society .Blockchain Platforms have led to development of smart contract driven networks that can facilitate peer to peer transactions without an intermediary .
 
Problems of Blockchain Based Governance :
1.) Smart Contracts cannot change with the changing society
2.) Governance in decentralized network is still controlled by creators alone
3.) No platform to manage community resource

# Ballot
An issue can be implemented with any possible ballot design according to the specifications defined in the constitutional smart contract of the organization. 

# Interface
-	SingleChoice: One selectable choice. 
-	MultipleChoice: at least one selectable alternatives. 
-	Cardinal: A given score for every alternative with a pre-characterized scope of significant worth. 
-	Ranked: Sortable alternatives as positioned inclinations. Bolt's inconceivability hypothesis must be thought about for any advancement with respect to positioned votes. This hypothesis expresses that rank-based appointive frameworks are not ready to fulfill reasonableness on three key perspectives in the meantime

# Alternatives 
So as to empower the data preparing of votes, Sensus Ballot Protocol is deployed . This lets vote exchanges flag a choice express that will go about as a power displaying the institutional decisions for the executing association. This makes every decentralized association additionally into programmable establishments. Choices would then be able to be: 
False: Signals a false state (e.g. can show 'No' or 'Negative' names). 
Connected: The alternative is associated with another choice inside the association. 
Applicant: A part or rundown of Members from the association. This enables choose experts inside the association or it to can be utilized for enrollment endorsements.

# Budget Protocol
Each Organization can have at least 1 digital currency delivers to finance its endeavors. Sovereign licenses to subsidize an Organization with Bitcoin and in its Constitution characterize a criteria on how these advantages get dispersed among Members: 

•Percentage for Proof of Identity: Applicant Members can present their Proof of Identity confirmation to get participation endorsement to an Organization. On the off chance that votes support the new part, it reinforces the notoriety of a self-sovereign character in the open system by remunerating him or her a settled measure of Bitcoin to allow hashing the Proof of Identity on a blockchain. A few Organizations may permit a greater reward than others, adequately making a Reputation score that can ensure the system against Sybils or false personalities. 

•Percentage for Issues: Members trying to utilize assets from the Organization can ask for them by joining a Budget to an Issue. A Member can demand to utilize stores from a pool particularly held for this. On the off chance that the last count of a choice achieves a specific esteem (genuine or false), it would then be able to authorize a ultimate conclusion by opening coins or setting off an exchange sending the asked for advantages for a particular address.
# Quadratic Voting
A key setting of a fluid majority rules system framework is to allow quadratic voting. In quadratic voting, the quantity of votes went through increments quadratically with the quantity of votes got. That is, if Alice needs a proposition to get one vote, she can burn through one vote on that issue. Be that as it may, on the off chance that she needs the proposition to get two votes (i.e., voting twice), it will cost her four votes. To give 100 votes to a solitary proposition, i.e., vote 100 times, she should burn through 10,000 votes (100 x 100). 
Quadratic voting attempts to keep away from imposing business model power by diminishing the peripheral advantage of extra votes. A big name who gathers 1,000,000 designated votes just picks up spending power proportional to 1,000 votes if connected to any single issue. People are subsequently disincentivized to appoint votes to somebody who has just been assigned countless. In the event that Alice has 100 votes, they would be worth 10 votes if Alice utilizes them all herself to vote straightforwardly on a proposition (10 x 10 = 100). However, in the event that Alice assigns her 100 votes to Bob, who as of now has 2,500 votes, at that point those 100 votes from Alice are just worth around 1 vote when spent by Bob on a solitary issue (since Bob would go from having the capacity to vote 50 times on a solitary issue to having the capacity to vote 51 times). 
In the event that a few associations want a more vertical hierarchy of leadership (e.g. partnerships), quadratic voting can at present be impaired in the protected keen contract of a Sovereign execution.





Community governance is a model of governance where a community of users is governance according to the constitution created by the community itself . 

# For Example:
Community X = Community of Users 
Governance = Community X Governance Mechanism 
Governance Mechanism = Constitution Protocol Deployed by Users 
Stakeholders = Users X

Governance = Constitution X + Users X 
Decision + Consensus = Action 
Consensus > 51% Vote 
Void < 51% Vote 
Majority = Consensus 


Sensus Governance Protocol is a governance mechanism which is deployed by a community for community governance via cryptographic blockchain built upon Ethereum network. Sensus Governance Protocol is the constitution created by the community which can be amended by a community consensus. The governance protocol is created by the deployment of Sensus Network Code which creates Community Constitution which governs the functioning of the community. 

Sensus Protocol = Community X + Constitution X + Amendment Protocol + Budgetary Protocol 
Amendment Protocol = Proposal + Consensus = Change in Constitution X
Voting = Binary Option + Checkbox Option
Binary Option = Yes or No
Checkbox Option = Input Value
